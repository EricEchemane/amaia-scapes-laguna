### Running the application

- the frontend is written in `Nextjs` and the backend is written in `NestJS` - a nodejs framework

- install yarn globaly if you don't have

  ```bash
  npm i -g yarn
  ```

- install dependencies

  ```bash
  yarn && cd backend && yarn && yarn prisma migrate dev && cd .. && cd frontend && yarn && cd ..
  ```

- start both backend and frontend at once (concurrently)

  ```bash
  yarn dev
  ```

- you can start backend and frontend separately by changing the current directory and runnung yarn dev to both of them

- Frontend is available on port `3000` and backend is on port `80`
